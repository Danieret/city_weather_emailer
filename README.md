# city_weather_emailer
This is a Python script that automates the process of sending an email with the current weather in a chosen city. To use the script, you will need to obtain an API key from the OpenWeatherMap website and register for a free account.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this script, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can check if you have Python installed by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing the following command:
python --version

If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need to install the following Python packages:

requests
smtplib

You can install these packages using pip by typing the following command:
pip install requests smtplib

## Usage

To use the script, you will need to provide your OpenWeatherMap API key, city name, sender email address, receiver email address, and password for the sender email account. You can provide these details either by modifying the values directly in the script or by using environment variables.
